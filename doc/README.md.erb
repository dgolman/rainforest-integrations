# Rainforest Integrations

This is a small web service for outbound integrations from
Rainforest.

## API
`POST /events`
Rainforest will post events to this endpoint (see below for details
and the format).

`GET /integrations/:key`
Return the schema of settings for a particular integration (see below
for the format).

`GET /integrations`
Return a list of schemas for all supported integrations.

### General flow
Rainforest will check the API endpoint for the required settings keys
for each integration. Every event will be posted to the `events`
endpoint (Rainforest will determine which events to post based on user
preferences). The payload for the `events` post should contain all the
information necessary to complete integration event, including all
authentication and user settings.

### `POST /events`
#### Request payload
Each post to `events` should include a JSON object in the request body
with the following keys:

- `event_name`: The event name key (see below for more details).
- `integrations`: A list of integrations to post the event to. Each
  integration object should have 2 keys: `key`, which is the key name
  of the integration (e.g. `"slack"`), and `settings`, which is an
  object with integration-specific settings (including all
  authentication settings).
- `payload`: The appropriate event data (event-specific, see below for
  the payload types for each event).

#### Response
`POST /events` will return a 201 response on success with a
`{"status": "ok"}` object. On failure due to a bad request, it will
return a 400 response and an object with two keys:

- `error`: A description of the error that that occurred.
- `type`: The type of failure (currently one of `invalid_request`,
  `unsupported_integration`, or `misconfigured_integration`).

### `GET /integrations`
#### Response
`GET /integrations` will return a list of schemas for all supported
integrations, each of which has the following keys:

- `key`: The unique key of the integration (e.g. `"slack"`).
- `title`: A human-readable title for the integration name
  (e.g. `"Slack"`).
- `settings`: A list of possible settings for the integration. Each
  setting has three keys: `key`, the key name for the setting;
  `title`, a human-readable title for the setting; and `required`, a
  boolean indicating whether the setting is required.

The response object for an individual integration follows the same
format.

## Event payload
Events come with a payload that is specific to the event. The
following events are currently supported, with the corresponding keys
in the payload:

<% @events.each do |event_name, data_hashes| %>
#### `<%= event_name %>`
<% data_hashes.each do |key, fields| %>
- **<%= key %>**: <%= fields.join(", ") unless fields.nil? %>
<% end %>
<% end %>


## Adding integrations
There are two steps to adding a new integration:

1. Add an integration class to the `lib/integrations` directory. This
   should inherit from the `Integrations::Base` class and should
   overwrite the `send_event` method. If the integration post is
   unsuccessful, you should raise one of the following errors:
   `Integrations::UserConfigurationError` for user configuration
   problems (such as invalid credentials);
   `Integrations::MisconfiguredIntegrationError` for non-user problems
   in the integrations data from Rainforest; and `Integrations::Error`
   for all other problems.
2. Edit `data/integrations.yml` to add your integration (including the
   appropriate values for `title` and `settings`).

1. Clone this repository
2. `bundle install`
3. You need to set the environment variable `INTEGRATION_SENTRY_DSN` (no default included due to the public nature of this project)
4. `rails s`
